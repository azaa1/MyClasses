# C Programming Language Fundamentals

### *C* is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development. Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language.
